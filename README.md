<h1> Pick and Drop Drone </h1>
<p><ul><li>A gazebo simulation of a pick and drop drone was implemented by my team under the theme Vitarana Drone, EYRC-2021. The drone model was provided  EYRC. The drone consists of a gps, imu, laserscanners and a camera.</li> <br> <li>The drone is capable of picking up a box from a given gps coordinates, then scans the QR code on the box of the delivery location, when it reaches to scanned QR codes coordinates, due to inaccurracy it goes into a search pattern and uses Harr Cascade method to detect thedelivery pad. </li><br> <li>A PID has been tuned for stable flight of the drone. </li></ul></p>
